            I had an absolute blast taking on a workshop at the muWi Stained Glass Museum in Krakow!
            </p>


            <p>
                Two weeks ago, I had the pleasure of spending the weekend in Krakow. In preparation, I did a lot of research into different sites 
                and activities to check out, and one that stood out to me was the muWi Stained Glass Museum. I love art museums, and I had never 
                been to one focused solely on this unique medium. I didn't make it to muWi on that trip, but when I realized they also offered workshops 
                where visitors could make their own stained glass creation, I immediately planned to head back for a day the following weekend. One of 
                my absolute favorite things in the world is trying out new crafting disciplines, and I could not pass up such an incredible opportunity. 
                Maybe it's my inner-grandma showing, but I'm never happier than when I'm in an arts/crafts class or workshop (besides when I'm in a 
                bookstore.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Entry to the workshop included a tour of the museum's workshop and core exhibition. The tour was incredibly informative, and the 
                exhibition featured some breathtaking works, my favorite of which are bordered with gold. The tour guide described the process of 
                constructing a complex stained glass work, detailing the preparation that takes place when designing and scaling the work, then 
                showing us how the painting process uses layers of a glass-based paint that requires firing in a kiln to become permanent. A fun 
                fact that stood out to me was that you'll rarely see pink in a stained glass work because it is the hardest glass to manufacture.

                I also had the opportunity to visit their temporary exhibition, <a href="https://muzeumwitrazu.pl/ongoing-exhibitions/"><i>All about flowers: Krakow School of Stained Glass</i></a>, which 
                featured beautiful works created in the style of the Krakow School of Stained Glass and the propensity of its students in the 
                late nineteenth century to depict flowers.

                Finally, it was time for the workshop! I was the only one from my group to stay after the tour, so I got to work one-on-one with 
                the instructor. We began by choosing which pieces of glass I wanted to work with and which template I would use to create my piece.
            </p>

            <p>
                After that, the first step was to cut out rectangular pieces based on the stencils from the template, use the grindstone to 
                get rid of any sharp edges, and shape the cut-outs into even rectangles of the right size. This step was a little tough for 
                me because I always have a hard time telling if things are straight and even.
            </p>
            <img src="../stainedglass/workshop3.jpeg" height="600" width="500">
            <p>
                Next, we added copper tape to the edges of each piece of glass. This gives the lead something to bind to in the next step, 
                as it doesn't naturally stick to glass.
            </p>
            <img src="../stainedglass/workshop4.jpeg" height="600" width="500">

            <p>
                Finally, we brushed the copper taped with acid and soldered the work together using lead and a soldering iron. I have never 
                soldered before, and while it was a bit nervewracking holding something so incredibly hot, the process itself was super satisfying.
            </p>

                And here is the finished product! I had a ridiculous amount of fun at this workshop and at muWi. The staff was incredibly kind and 
                knowledgable, and I did leave with a temptation to run away to Poland and become a stained glass artist in their workshop. 
                If you ever get the chance to visit Krakow, I highly recommend this museum and experience!
