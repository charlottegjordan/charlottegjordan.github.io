               For Thanksgiving Break this year, I had the pleasure of visiting my East Coast family in Maryland, and while I was in the area, I just had to see the 
               Baltimore Museum of Art.

                In the European Art Collection, I was repeatedly awestruck by the level of detail and textural accuracy in the featured works, particularly in relation to fabrics and textiles. 
                At several pieces, I had to spend several minutes looking at the paintings from different angles like a cliché art snob and getting as close to the paintings as possible without setting 
                of proximity alarms and getting tackled to the ground by museum security. In particular, the shine and silkiness of the blue dress in Sir Anthony van Dyck’s <i>The Marchioness of Worcester</i> was 
                so lifelike and decadent that it was difficult to look away. Staring at that painting, it felt as though I could reach up and gather the stiff, smooth hem in my fist (which would also probably 
                get me tackled by a museum attendant.) Additional paintings with such visceral, tangible texture are collected below, along with closeups that highlight their precision. I also felt BMA’s

                European collection featured an exciting spectrum of emotion and position in its portraits, subversion of my own misconceptions about European Art that always excites me. The subjects of several 
                paintings communicate guarded, nuanced expressions of sly humor, haughty disinterest, and compelling personality as opposed to the soft composure I most often associate with European portraiture. 
                For example, in Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin’s <i>The Game of Knucklebones</i>, I was surprised by both the young girl’s warm, complacent smile, the depiction of an airborne object in motion, and the 
                subject of mundane play. The painting exudes a sweet personality and an air of playful complicity, as the girl’s apron and discarded scissors and fabric at her left suggests she is shirking her 
                seamstress duties to goof around with us, the viewers.

                From the European Collection, we moved into the Modern Art Collection, which was largely composed of the works collected 
                by the Cone Sisters, Etta and Claribel. Aside from the wonderful works in the collection, my favorite part of browsing this section of the 
                museum was learning about the Cone Sisters in a small room curated like a sitting room with cleverly disguised drawers and cabinets filled 
                with background on the collection’s founders. Their illustrious collection of modern art was beyond impressive, and as I strolled from painting 
                to painting, I couldn’t help but feel this was one of the best legacies a person could leave behind, especially to their home city (Casini).

                Upon entering, it was impossible not to get swept into the current of the 20th-century cast of Degas’s <i>Little Dancer, Aged Fourteen</i> standing across 
                from its reinterpretation, <i>Meredith</i> by Simone Leigh. I have been a fan of the Little Dancer since following The Met’s documentation of the original 
                work’s restoration on TikTok, and seeing such a sweet, moving reimagining was exciting and surprisingly emotional. On BMA Stories, Curator Jessica 
                Bell Brown gives a lovely description of the pieces’ orbit: “Showing Leigh in context with Degas amplifies the complexities that Leigh was grappling 
                with in her sculpture, which really inhabits the form of Degas’s bronzed ballerina to tell a different story altogether of Black diasporic women across 
                generations,” whose inclusion in the Cone Collection’s galleries “initiates a whole new conversation about Black women and girls, networks of care, 
                creative collaboration, and knowledge sharing” (“Showstoppers”).
            </p>
            <p>
                The fabric skirt of the bronze dancer’s skirt is one of <i>Little Dancer</i>’s most defining features, and the reinterpretation of this element as “a raffia skirt, 
                which references the conical thatched roof houses created by Batammariba architects in northern Togo and Benin” cleverly “merges the sculptural traditions of 
                Europe with the legacies of the African diaspora” (“Showstoppers”). The positioning of these sculptures also brought to mind the ongoing cultural discussion 
                that Black girls often lose the privilege of childhood faster in society than white girls of the same age, which is an observed social behavior (Epstein et al. 8). 
                Degas’s <i>Little Dancer</i> is the pinnacle of sweetness, youth, and girlhood by American and English standards; her innocence is immediately recognizable by her earnest 
                and playful stance, as well as by the hopeful outfit that reflects her dancing ambitions. In setting <i>Meredith</i> directly across, viewers understand that these girls 
                are of the same sweetness and purity, with the same potential, playfulness, and naivete. <i>Meredith</i>’s clothes and stance reflect the same exact youthfulness as <i>Little Dancer</i>’s, 
                and we this sweet girl a disservice by ignoring her childhood on the arbitrary basis of our cultural standards.

                As I walked further into the collection, I was inundated with famous work by modern masters like Matisse, Picasso, and Cezanne. However, it was a piece that I didn’t recognize that 
                caught my eye the strongest. I am a big fan of Matisse, but when I saw <i>Large Cliff with Fish</i> among several iconic Matisse works, I was caught off guard by its uniqueness among its peers. 
                When I think of Matisse’s most prolific works, I think of warm-toned indoor scenes with glamorous human subjects, and what little animal or natural elements are domesticated, like pet cats 
                or house plants. As such, this little tranquil microcosm of nature in a sea of Matisse’s rich reds and playful purples had the true effect of fresh, misty air on a seashore.

                I next moved to the exhibit, <i>The Way of Nature: Art from Japan, China, and Korea</i>, which featured works that represent the belief in several East Asian cultures that viewed human life 
                as part of a much larger system that encompasses the natural world” (“The Way of Nature”). Walking past a beautiful garment that served as a Japanese firefighter’s protective coat in 
                the early-to-mid 20th century, I was at first unmoved by Hiroshi Sugimoto’s <i>Arctic Ocean, Nordkapp</i> because I though it was a solid block of black ink. However, after reading the work’s 
                description, which pointed out that the photographer actually captured the line of the horizon, I took a closer look, and was only then able to see the lines of tides and scope of sky. 
                I really like this work because, though its secretive nature played a funny trick on me, it’s actually a very somber and melancholically beautiful portrait.

                Moving on through the gallery, I was next drawn in by the unusual medium of fabric and feathers in Reiko Sudo’s <i>Feather Flurries</i>. Up close, the effect of the layered fabrics and trapped guinea 
                feathers suspended in false motion was wholly unique, like some technology or textile from a sci-fi book. Though I have a hard time articulating what draws me to this work, I can say that it is one of 
                the most singular works I think I have ever seen.
