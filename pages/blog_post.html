            Take a look at some of the amazing museums I got to visit during my summer in Warsaw!
            </p>

            <p>
                Warsaw is an incredible city with a wealth of amazing museums, and in my time interning at POLIN Museum of the History of Polish 
                Jews this summer, I had the opportunity to visit many of them. As a bit of a disclaimer, this photo diary will only feature the 
                light-hearted museums I visited in Warsaw. This city has a rich and often tragic history, which I spent much of this summer 
                studying. This blog doesn't feel like an appropriate place to explore the memory of Warsaw's tragedies, considering it's lighter tone. I also consider 
                this blog a personal project and would like to keep the professional and academic work I did this summer largely separate. That 
                being said, I absolutely recommend visiting some of the world-class history museums in Warsaw if you get the opportunity. Here 
                are a few that I can personally recommend:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews</li>
                <li>Museum of Pawiak Prison</li>
                <li>Mausoleum of Struggle and Martyrdom</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Now that that disclaimer is out of the way, here are some of the great museums Warsaw has to offer!
            </p>

            <br>
            <h2>Marie Curie Museum</h2>
            <p>
                This is one of my new all-time favorite museums. Aside from my personal interest in the history of 
                science, and aside from the excitement that comes with learning about a famous Varsovian while in Warsaw, Marie Curie was an exceptional scientist and a fascinating historical figure, making for a 
                perfect museum subject. The exhibition was the perfect size and did an amazing job giving equal acknowledgment 
                to her identities as a woman, scientist, and public figure, along with all the complex intersections of 
                those identities. The exhibit humanized her while maintaining the enormity of her genius, and it shed 
                light on the achievements of her daughters, about whom I knew very little. The temporary exhibition focused 
                on Curie's daughter and her writing of her mother's most famous biography, which was a great complimentary 
                topic to the main exhibit's content.

            <p>
                One of my favorite parts of the main exhibit's curation was the inclusion of clear partitions displaying pressed 
                flowers. Upon first glance, I was confused by their presence. As it turns out, the flowers displayed 
                were chosen for their symbolic meaning, as each virtue or emotion represented by the flowers correspondeded 
                thematically to the point in Curie's life that was currently being discussed. For example, marigolds, which are meant to 
                symbolize grief and sadness at the absence of another person, were placed in the section that described the 
                untimely passing of Marie Curie's husband. This approach to curation is unique and incredibly compelling, and I found it 
                to be a really meaningful, emotional addition to the flow of the exhibit.
