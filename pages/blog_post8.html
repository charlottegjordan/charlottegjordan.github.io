            Recently, I spent a weekend checking out a small slice of the amazing Asian art scene in Los Angeles!
            </p>

            <p>
                Highly popular Japanese artist Aya Takano presented her show <i>how deep how far we can go</i> at the Perrotin Art Gallery in Los Angeles 
                from July 19 to August 29, 2025. I was mainly familiar with Takano due to her significant popularity with my fellow aesthetic queens 
                on Pinterest. I had only seen a few examples of her distinctly sweet, colorful work, but what I had seen had me highly curious and 
                highly eager to see this show, and thankfully I made it on the last day the show was open. The following day, I visited a cultural 
                institution of Los Angeles, Giant Robot and GR2, descendants of the Asian American pop culture magazine <i>Giant Robot</i>, which was founded 
                by Eric Nakamura and Martin Wong and ran from 1994 to 2010. Both are great samples of the vibrant, highly active Asian art scene that 
                often defines visual culture in Los Angeles and abroad.

                When I arrived at Takano’s show, I was surprised to find it very busy, and I was thrown off by the amount of people taking pictures in 
                front of the artworks. Once I got used to the crowded environment, I spent awhile walking to each painting and reading the accompanying 
                description written by Takano to contextualize the works’ places in the show’s narrative. To me, the show seemed to be a comprehensive 
                representation of the communities inherent to human life, beginning with family, or the community of humans with each other, first in 
                the present then throughout time and ancestry; next the connections between humans and animals through cohabitation of this Earth; then 
                the fundamental relationship between humans and their natural surroundings; and finally, the communion between humans and the spiritual dimension.

            <p>
                I most enjoyed the nature-related pieces, especially <i>the spirit of all minerals on earth</i> (2025) and <i>the spirit of all plant on earth</i> (2025), 
                which personify the spirits in their respective titles as enigmatic women set against beautiful backdrops. These pieces have everything I 
                love in Takano’s work: specifically, I love her female characters and the stunning, dreamy, ethereal use of color, as both remind me of the 
                illustrations of fairies and mermaids that left me breathless as a kid. As with those beautiful depictions of mystical femininity, these pieces 
                transport me into a soft, kaleidoscopic world where I dreamed of wearing a dress made of flower petals and jewelry made of seashells.

                I was also taken by the piece <i>childhood</i> (2025). I attended this show after just coming back from a summer away from my family, and this work appealed to the 
                sentimentality I was overwhelmed with for my sisters.

            <p>
                I seriously enjoyed this show and seeing a concise collection of Aya Takano’s excellent work. Afterward, I decided to step into the other show Perrotin 
                was hosting, Jin Meyerson’s Safe Space. Meyerson, a Seoul-based artist, transforms oil paint into <a href="https://leaflet.perrotin.com/view/1112/safe-space">“meta-locations”</a>, which he describes as “something akin 
                to the overview effect reported by astronauts.” I thought that that effect absolutely translated in his 
                works, and as someone who often wonders what higher dimensions look and feel like, I felt as though these works tapped into something we can’t yet understand, 
                in a way that also made me a little anxious while looking at them. As a sci-fi geek, I also loved that the paintings felt like sci-fi book covers.

                The following day, I visited Giant Robot and its gallery, GR2. I first heard of Giant Robot a few years ago, when I attended a temporary exhibition on the originating magazine at the Japanese American National Museum.

            <p>
                I loved seeing past magazine covers and works of featured artists, and years later, it was cool to finally visit their physical store and gallery in Sawtelle. There were some great 
                works on display, with some of my favorites coming from Felicia Chiao, Theo Ellsworth, and Kelly Yamagishi. I ended up buying a print of Felicia Chiao’s <i>Dread</i> and hanging it in my 
                dorm. Both locations are filled with adorable and wonderful pieces, and I intend on going back very soon!
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                I look forward to continuing to explore the enormous and talent-filled world of Asian art in LA!
