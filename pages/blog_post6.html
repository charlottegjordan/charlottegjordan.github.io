            Hear some of my opinions and analyses of the Yoshitomo Nara exhibition at the Hayward Gallery of the Southbank Centre in London, lasting from June 10 to August 31 2025.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                A few weeks ago, I mentioned in my Artist Spotlight of Yoshitomo Nara (link) that I hoped to see the 
                temporary Nara exhibit at the Southbank Center Hayward Gallery. Well, past-me, this is future-you, you 
                got to go to the exhibit! And definitely freaked out the other people in the galleries with how excited 
                you were! Also, you spent waaaaaaay too much money in the gift shop.
            </p>

            <p>
                The exhibit also featured a fantastic selection of Nara’s works, including some freed from private collections. 
                You can spot several works I mentioned in the Artist Spotlight:

            <p>
                This is my first time getting to see Nara’s work in-person since I went to his LACMA retrospective a few years ago, 
                and I was shocked by the profound effect that physical proximity had on my perception of his pieces. Seeing my 
                existing favorites was obviously fun and validating, but some works that I had seen in prints or online gained an 
                unexpected beauty when I saw them with my own eyes, and some I had never seen at all! After following an artist so 
                long and so closely, it is so unbelievably exciting to continue to be surprised and to keep discovering new favorites. 
                My phenomenal experience at this exhibit is also a testament to the importance of seeking out physical, in-person art, 
                and hopefully some of the pieces I’ll discuss will inspire you to check out a nearby art museum!
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <h2>Checking out existing favorites</h2>
            <p>
                In my Spotlight, I identified some of my favorite Nara works as <i>Lollipop</i> (1998), <i>Midnight Tears</i> (2023), <i>Harmless Kitty</i> 
                (1994), and <i>Fountain of Life</i> (2001), and of those works, I got to see all but Lollipop! I also got to see an unlisted 
                favorite, <i>Sleepless Night Sitting</i> (1997).
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <img src="../nara2/tear1.jpeg" width="300" height="400">
            <img src="../nara2/tear2.jpeg" width="300" height="400">

            <p>
                <i>Midnight Tears</i> stood as the star of its own wall at the back end of its room, and its position allowed it to immediately seize and 
                command the attention of anyone who entered. I was jumping around and squealing when I saw this work. When you stand in front of it 
                and really feel its emotion, it’s difficult not to tear up. Her colors are even more spectacular in-person, it’s like basking in soft sunlight.
            </p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <img src="../nara2/cat3.jpeg" width="300" height="400">

            <p>
                <i>Harmless Kitty</i> really transformed when it was in physically front of my eyes. I’ve loved it as a digital and printed experience, but seeing it as 
                a true, artistic creation of paint and canvas was inspiring. It was like a whole new work. I absolutely adored the fuzzy paint smudges that hover around 
                the edges of the catsuit, which usually get lost when I view this painting as a print. In the context of the painting, it could be pilling fuzz adding 
                visceral texture to her costume and dirt on a grubby child’s face after a day of play. Those smudges bring so much life and energy and character to this 
                painting, and seeing them up-close brought I whole new personality to my interpretation of this scene.
            </p>

            <img src="../nara2/fount3.jpeg" width="300" height="400">

            <p>
                <i>Fountain of Life</i> is my favorite sculpture of Nara’s, and it’s quite imposing in person. My twin sister came to the exhibition with me, and it was really 
                fun to see her reaction to this piece because she wasn’t aware that Nara made sculptures and ceramics. The faces are soft and beautiful, and the tears that 
                flow from their eyes are stunningly beautiful yet subtle. I was so excited to point the tears out to my sister, and they had the desired effect. 
                The all-white statue gives off a lovely glow, and with the water element, the environment of the statue is gentle and soothing.
            </p>

            <img src="../nara2/lamb2.jpeg" width="300" height="400">

            <p>
                <i>Sleepless Night Sitting</i> has a really lovely layering of colors, particularly in the lamb suit and the character’s skin, that makes a character in stationary position 
                feel brightly animated and lively. I love that the lamb onesie looks so soft and velvety, as though they might be this character’s PJs as he waits for a glass of warm 
                milk to lull him back to sleep. Another element that reinforces the title’s suggestion of a nighttime setting is the character’s glowing eyes. I adore that detail, as 
                though the character is exhibiting the odd glowing effect that green eyes get when they are photographed with flash.

            <h2>Gawking at works I've never seen</h2>

            <p>
                There were a shocking amount of stunning works that I had never seen before, whether 
                because they are less discussed, less documented, or previously trapped in private collections 
                (ick!). Finding so many works I had never seen had me giddy and gob-smacked; I think I spooked 
                some of my fellow museum-goers by gasping out loud at a few of the works I’m featuring below. Here 
                are a few that really struck me:
            </p>

            <p>
                I got such a kick out of <i>Wild One</i> (2024). When my sister and I were standing before it, I observed that
                 it was emulating a charcoal drawing with dryer brushstrokes of black paint, and I loved seeing my sister
                 take in that clever technique. It’s a work that really reminds me of my twin in subject and medium, and
                 now it holds a special place in my heart as one we got to experience for the first time together.
            </p>

            <p>
                <i>Cup Kid</i> (2000) is one of my new favorite artworks ever. Though tiny in size, its charisma is absolutely enormous 
                and completely caught my eye, more than any of the larger artworks in the room. It is just a compact package of 
                humor and sweetness. I adore seeing Nara’s hypermodern style and character interact with a style and character 
                from traditional Japanese art, it somehow makes them both so much more human. It feels as though Nara’s little 
                girl is in a kooky time-travel Alice-in-Wonderland scenario and she’s time-travelled right into this woman’s teacup. 
                It might be such an exciting work to me because it reminds me of the episodes of animated shows when the artists 
                animate the characters in completely new aesthetics for special episodes, or when showrunners would do crossovers 
                and unexpected characters of different art styles would interact.

                I greatly enjoyed seeing <i>Untitled</i> (2007) and <i>After the Acid Rain</i> (2006) in person for similar 
                reasons, which were the unexpected, three-dimensional or light-based details that don’t translate 
                in photographs. The eyes of both girls are galactic in color and light-spots, but what I never 
                realized when seeing them in pictures is that they are glazed with subtle glitter that gives them a 
                breath-taking effect in person. That added dimension made me want to stare at these paintings from 
                every angle, as every step to the left or right brought out a different, lovely aspect of the works. 
                The depth of color of both works’ backgrounds was also easier to appreciate in person, particularly 
                in <i>After the Acid Rain</i>. Another really fun and playful detail I had never caught until I saw <i>Untitled</i> 
                (2007) in person is that the eye patch placed on the girl’s right eye is a genuine piece of fabric or 
                paper fastened on with actual pieces of tape. The detail was so tactile and visceral that I wanted to 
                reach out and touch it (I didn’t obviously).

            <p>
                <i>Mumps</i> (1996) and <i>Abandoned Puppy</i> (1995) were two more works that were made more special by viewing 
                them with my twin. I remarked that the characters have such exuberant personalities and the colors 
                have such a unique disposition that you don’t even realize they’re virtually colorless, and my sister 
                got a kick out of that interpretation. It feels like an optical illusion or imposed color blindness. 
                In the end, <i>Mumps</i> ended up being my twin’s favorite work of the exhibit, and it’s always so exciting 
                to see people close to you connect with art you love.

                <i>Walk On I</i> (1993) was the absolute star of the exhibit to me, and I walked back around to see it twice. 
                I’ve seen prints and pictures of this work several times, and while I liked it, it was never in my list 
                of favorites. However, this piece was just unbelievably beautiful, effervescent, and breathtaking in person. 
                My jaw was on the floor, and I honestly teared up a little looking at it. I was completely caught off-guard 
                by the effect this work had on me, and I can’t entirely explain it, but the gentle glow of its soft colors, 
                the whimsy of its subject and its odd surroundings, and the overarching cloudy effect creating suede-like 
                texture all combined to stop me in my tracks. This was my favorite work of the entire exhibit, and I’ve 
                thought of it every day since.

            <p>
                I enjoyed every minute of attending this exhibit, and I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to 
                attend! I hope this inspires you to check out art exhibits in person, as you never know the effect that 
                seeing works in person can have on your artistic perspective!
            </p>
