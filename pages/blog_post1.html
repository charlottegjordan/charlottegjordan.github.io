            Learn about trending artist Yoshitomo Nara and hear me reflect on my favorite of his works!
            </p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                About four years ago, I spent a summer day visiting LACMA‚Äîthis summer was the birth of my interest in art, as an injury took me out of my ridiculously intense practice schedule for club swim. Up to this point, swim had dictated every single aspect of my schedule, and I suddenly had to reckon with this terrifying and foreign concept of choice. I had long adapted the mindset that choosing to do something for fun was only acceptable if it didn‚Äôt interfere with swim, and finding ways to fill my summer days still felt like an uneasy act of rebellion. I ended up settling on a few main activities: going to the movies (I saw literally every movie in my local movie theater on several occasions), reading, crafting, and going to museums.
            </p>

            <p>
                Going to museums was a cheap yet gratifying way to spend time---it was an activity I enjoyed doing alone, and it was a good way to practice driving in LA, as I had gotten my driver‚Äôs license recently, and driving in LA is something they can‚Äôt really prepare you for in Driver‚Äôs Ed. That would probably involve more cussing, illegal maneuvers, crying, and creative hand gestures than DMV liability insurance covers. Art museums were my absolute favorite. They were the most immersive, interesting, and had the best gift stores. I should have been given donor status and put on the Board of Trustees for how much money I spent at art museum gift stores that summer.
            </p>

            <p>
                I struggled with core exhibits: they were overwhelming and hard to engage with emotionally with the breadth of themes and chronology. As such, temporary exhibits were my favorite, and whenever a new one opened, regardless of its topic, I was there. That‚Äôs how I ended up at a retrospective on Yoshitomo Nara in the summer of 2021. It was and is the quickest I have ever become smitten with an artist‚Äôs work. Through all of the change and growth that accompanied the following years, Nara‚Äôs art remained some of my absolute favorite and brought significant comfort in tougher times. I bought a poster from this retrospective (in my beloved gift store, of course), and it‚Äôs been on every wall of every room I‚Äôve resided in since.
            </p>

            <p>
                I became more aware of Nara‚Äôs global fame over the next few years through his cult following on Pinterest (the best app ever created.) I stumbled across his work organically, and as a budding art appreciator, I kind of claimed him as mine. It‚Äôs like when you find a really good song on Spotify and it‚Äôs your favorite song for two weeks, then you come across a viral TikTok with the song as its audio and realize it has a substantial fanbase already. It‚Äôs embarrassing to admit how ignorant I was to his popularity, but since this discovery, I‚Äôve found it to be a positive thing because I love talking to other people that enjoy his work.
            </p>

            <p>
                Like any artist who even brushes the mainstream, there were people who wore Nara‚Äôs art on clothing or hung it on their walls without knowing who created it. I think that‚Äôs a natural phenomena‚Äîpopular stores often seek out artists on the cusp of mainstream attention and create collaborative product lines, and the average person sees this cool design and wants to be closer to it. Like any other product in the store, there isn‚Äôt much of a reason to seek out the designer; imagine going to Target and finding a cool graphic tee, and being like ‚ÄúI must know who designed this Minecraft x Paw Patrol masterpiece!‚Äù After this exhibit, I continued to wear the t-shirt I bought from this exhibit without thinking too much about where it came from.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the past few years, I‚Äôve been trying to be more intentional about curiosity. If I really like something, I try to push myself to learn beyond the initial interest. Despite how much I‚Äôve loved Nara the past few years, I knew very little about him, his artistic motivations, and the body of his work. As Nara has expressed, ‚ÄúThe impression of my work is too strong, so most people tend to look only at the surface, leaving most of the background hidden‚Äù (Miyamura). Through this spotlight, I am trying to make my consumption of his art more meaningful, and I want to be able to understand and articulate what draws me to his work to become a better appreciator of art.
